	\section*{Question 1 (25 points)}
	
	A private school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=40, lastline=40]{PS1.R}  
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	\noindent Find a 90\% confidence interval for the student IQ in the school assuming the population of IQ from which our random sample has been selected is normally distributed. 
	\vspace{.25cm}
	
	\noindent\textbf{Solution}
	
	\texttt {R} code:
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=27, lastline=35]{PS1_answers.R}
	
	Results: [94.13283, 102.74717]
		
	\vspace{1cm}
	\section*{Question 2 (25 points)}
	A private school counselor was curious  whether  the average of IQ of the students in her school is higher than the average IQ score 100 among all the schools in the country. She took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=46, lastline=46]{PS1.R}  
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	\noindent Conduct a test with 0.05 significance level assuming the population of IQ from which our random sample has been selected is normally distributed. 
	\vspace{.25cm}
	
	\noindent\textbf{Solution}
	
	\texttt {R} code:
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=40, lastline=50]{PS1_answers.R}
	
	\noindent\textbf{Results}
		
	Due to the p-value of 0.7215 being larger than the required significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and cannot accept the alternative hypothesis. The evidence does not supports the hypothesis that the average IQ students in the private school is higher than the average IQ score 100 among all the schools in the country.
